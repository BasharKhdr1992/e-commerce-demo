# E-commerce Demo app

## Features and Tools used

1. For a summary of the tools used in this project. please check out the repo description. It is basically a react project with SPA routing, and basic filtering
2. The user can filter the products based on their category. Once the category is clicked it will become highlighted.
3. The user can add products to a favourite list.
4. The user can go to a product's details page, or navigate to a favourites page where he/she can still filter out the add-to-favourite products based on the category

## Drawbacks
1. Unfortunately, this a pure frontend project, and the state will be lost once the user navigate away from the site.
